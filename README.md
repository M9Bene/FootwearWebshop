# FootwearWebshop

The back-end of a simple webshop for shoes ( later it will have front-end aswel ) 

### Tech stack:
- Java + Spring
- H2 database ( changed from PSQL for easier test/setup ) 

### Tests
- for testing use different spring profile named: test 


     because for repository testing there is a separate .sql file to init test data
